The Modal Object Library
by V.J. Manzo


The Modal Object Library is a collection of objects for Max/MSP that control modality created by V.J. Manzo.

To install, copy this folder into the Max/MSP file path. For added support copy the file, "Modal_Object_Library" into the folder "...\Cycling '74\MaxMSP\patches\extras". Then select Modal Object Library from "extras" when Max is running or simply type "modal_object_library" into a new object box.
